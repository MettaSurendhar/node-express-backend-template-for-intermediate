## Using the Features

### Authentication 
- The template includes basic authentication setup. You can find the authentication middleware in the middleware directory. Configure your authentication logic as needed.
### Database Integration 
- The template uses Sequelize ORM for database interactions. Define your models in the models directory and configure your database connection in the config directory.
### Validation 
- Use the pre-built validation middleware in the validators directory to validate incoming requests. This ensures that your application handles data consistently and securely.

## Examples

The Usage Guide includes several examples to help you understand how to use the template effectively:

- **Example 1**: Setting up a new route with validation and authentication.
- **Example 2**: Integrating a new database model and performing CRUD operations.
- **Example 3**: Configuring environment variables for different stages of development.
