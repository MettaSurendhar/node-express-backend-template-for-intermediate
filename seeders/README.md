## Database (mainly Sequelize's) seeders - initial data feed, for dummy data and testing

### Purpose

This folder contains seeders for initial data feed, including dummy data and testing data, for Sequelize's database models.

### Structure

The folder contains seed files that define the initial data to be inserted into the database tables.

### Content

Each seeder file within this folder defines a specific set of data to be inserted into a database table, including:

- The data to be inserted

- The model to which the data belongs

These seeders provide a convenient way to populate the database with initial data, making it easier to test and develop the application.

### Importance

The seeders defined in this folder play a critical role in providing initial data for the database, making it essential to maintain a clear and well-organized structure to ensure the data remains consistent, accurate, and easy to manage.
