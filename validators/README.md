# Validators

## Validators - middleware functions for request object validation

### Purpose

The validators folder contains middleware functions responsible for validating incoming requests to ensure they meet the required criteria. This helps to prevent invalid or malicious data from being processed by the application.

### Structure

The folder contains a single file, index.js, which exports a middleware function called validate.

### Content

- `index.js`: This file exports a middleware function called validate, which is responsible for checking for validation errors in incoming requests.

### Functionality

The validate middleware function performs the following tasks:

- **Validation Error Checking**: It uses the validationResult function from express-validator to check for validation errors in the request.

- **Error Extraction**: If errors are found, it extracts the error messages from the validation errors.

- **Error Response**: It returns a `400` error response with the extracted error messages.
  Implementation Details

The validate middleware function is implemented using the following modules:

- `express-validator`: Provides the validationResult function for checking validation errors.

- `typedefs`: Provides type definitions for the application.

- `jsonTransformer`: Provides the getNestedValuesString function for extracting nested error messages.

### Usage

To use the validate middleware function, simply import it into your JavaScript file and add it to your Express.js route as a middleware function
