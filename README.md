# Backend-Template

This repository provides a template for backend projects. It includes essential configurations, examples, and guidelines to help you set up your backend project efficiently.

## Contents

This repository contains the following folders and files:

- **Config:** Configuration files for the backend application, including database settings and environment variables.
- **Controllers:** Business logic functions that handle incoming requests and send responses to the client.
- **Keys:** Public and private key pairs used for certificate QR code signing and verification.
- **Middleware:** Middleware functions that handle specific tasks, such as authentication and validation, between the client request and the server response.
- **Migrations:** Database migration files used to manage changes to the database schema.
- **Models:** Database ORM models that define the structure and relationships of the database tables.
- **Routes:** Route definitions that determine the control flow of the API, specifying how incoming requests are handled and responded to.
- **Seeders:** Seeders for initial data feed, including dummy data and testing data, for Sequelize's database models.
- **Utils:** General, reusable functionalities unrelated to API, such as file archiving, date formatting, form data manipulation, JSON transformation, logging, mailing, QR code generation, encryption, and token management.
- **Validators:** Middleware functions for request object validation.
