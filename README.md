## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive template for backend projects, designed to streamline the setup process and ensure best practices are followed. It includes configurations for Node.js with Express.js, database integration using Sequelize ORM, and essential middleware for authentication and validation. The template is CI/CD ready, making it easy to deploy and maintain.

## Repo Structure

For more detailed information on each folder and file, please refer to the corresponding README pages linked below:

- **[Config](config/README.md):** Configuration files for the backend application, including database settings and environment variables.
- **[Controllers](controllers/README.md):** Business logic functions that handle incoming requests and send responses to the client.
- **[Keys](keys/README.md):** Public and private key pairs used for certificate QR code signing and verification.
- **[Middleware](middleware/README.md):** Middleware functions that handle specific tasks, such as authentication and validation, between the client request and the server response.
- **[Migrations](migrations/README.md):** Database migration files used to manage changes to the database schema.
- **[Models](models/README.md):** Database ORM models that define the structure and relationships of the database tables.
- **[Routes](routes/README.md):** Route definitions that determine the control flow of the API, specifying how incoming requests are handled and responded to.
- **[Seeders](seeders/README.md):** Seeders for initial data feed, including dummy data and testing data, for Sequelize's database models.
- **[Utils](utils/README.md):** General, reusable functionalities unrelated to API, such as file archiving, date formatting, form data manipulation, JSON transformation, logging, mailing, QR code generation, encryption, and token management.
- **[Validators](validators/README.md):** Middleware functions for request object validation.

## Features

- **Pre-configured for Node.js with Express.js**: This template comes with a pre-configured setup for Node.js using Express.js, which streamlines the process of building robust and scalable backend applications. It includes essential middleware and configurations to get you started quickly.

- **Database Integration using Sequelize ORM**: Simplifies database interactions by integrating Sequelize ORM, which supports multiple SQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MSSQL. This allows for easy database management and operations through a consistent API.

- **Basic Authentication Setup**: Includes middleware for user authentication and authorization, providing a secure foundation for managing user sessions and permissions. This setup supports JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.

- **Comprehensive Folder Structure**: The project is organized into well-defined folders for controllers, models, routes, and more. This structure ensures a clean and maintainable codebase, making it easier to navigate and manage the project as it grows.

- **Middleware for Validation**: Pre-built middleware for request validation using popular libraries like Joi. This ensures that incoming requests are validated against defined schemas, reducing the risk of invalid data entering your application.

- **Environment Configuration**: Easy management of environment variables for different stages of development (development, testing, production). This is achieved through the use of a `.env` file, which allows you to configure settings specific to each environment.

- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling to manage and log errors effectively. This includes custom error classes and middleware to catch and handle errors gracefully, ensuring that your application remains stable and user-friendly.

- **Security Best Practices**: Includes security middleware to protect against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery). This helps to ensure that your application is secure by default.

- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to scale with your application's growth, supporting modular development. This means you can easily add new features and components without disrupting the existing codebase.

- **Detailed Documentation**: Each folder and file is documented with its purpose and usage, making it easier for new contributors to get started. This includes README files for each major directory, providing clear instructions and examples.
