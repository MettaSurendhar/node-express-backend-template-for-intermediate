# Routes

## Routes - define control flow of the API route

### Purpose

This folder contains route definitions that determine the control flow of the API, specifying how incoming requests are handled and responded to.

### Structure

The folder contains route files that define the API endpoints, including the HTTP methods, paths, and handlers for each route.

### Content

Each route file within this folder defines a specific API endpoint, including:

- The HTTP method (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

- The path of the endpoint (e.g. /users, /products)

- The handler function that processes the request and returns a response

These route definitions work together to form the overall API architecture, providing a clear and organized way to manage the flow of requests and responses.

### Importance

The routes defined in this folder play a critical role in determining the behavior and functionality of the API, making it essential to maintain a clear and well-organized structure to ensure the API remains scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand.
