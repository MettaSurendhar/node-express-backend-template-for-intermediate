3. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
4. **Start the development server**: Use `npm run dev` to start the development server. This will launch the project locally, allowing you to see your changes in real-time.

1. **Follow coding standards**: Adhere to the coding standards outlined in the repository. This includes consistent indentation, meaningful variable names, and comprehensive comments.
2. **Run tests**: Before submitting a pull request, run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass. Writing tests for your code helps maintain the project's stability and reliability.
3. **Use linters**: Utilize linters like ESLint to catch common errors and enforce coding standards. You can set up ESLint by following the ESLint Getting Started guide.
